# TicTacToe
Windows Form Application that plays the game of Tic Tac Toe. This is my first attempt at AI. 

The overall idea of the application was simple and once I did a bit of research it was not too difficult. There was one issue that I had in regards to the check function. Nothing stack overflow couldn't help with. 

The game now works perfecly and I have added styling to make the game more aesthetically pleasing.
